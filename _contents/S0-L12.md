+ The rapid development and deployment of large language models (LLMs) have introduced a new frontier in artificial intelligence, marked by unprecedented capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. However, the increasing integration of these models into critical applications raises substantial safety concerns, necessitating a thorough examination of their potential risks and associated mitigation strategies.
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of LLM safety, covering four major categories: value misalignment, robustness to adversarial attacks, misuse, and autonomous AI risks. In addition to the comprehensive review of the mitigation methodologies and evaluation resources on these four aspects, we further explore four topics related to LLM safety: the safety implications of LLM agents, the role of interpretability in enhancing LLM safety, the technology roadmaps proposed and abided by a list of AI companies and institutes for LLM safety, and AI governance aimed at LLM safety with discussions on international cooperation, policy proposals, and prospective regulatory directions. Our findings underscore the necessity for a proactive, multifaceted approach to LLM safety, emphasizing the integration of technical solutions, ethical considerations, and robust governance frameworks. This survey is intended to serve as a foundational resource for academy researchers, industry practitioners, and policymakers, offering insights into the challenges and opportunities associated with the safe integration of LLMs into society. Ultimately, it seeks to contribute to the safe and beneficial development of LLMs, aligning with the overarching goal of harnessing AI for societal advancement and well-being.

#### Privacy-Preserving Large Language Models: Mechanisms, Applications, and Future Directions
+ Guoshenghui Zhao, Eric Song
+ [Submitted on 9 Dec 2024]
+ The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural language processing, enabling applications in diverse domains such as healthcare, finance and education. However, the growing reliance on extensive data for training and inference has raised significant privacy concerns, ranging from data leakage to adversarial attacks. This survey comprehensively explores the landscape of privacy-preserving mechanisms tailored for LLMs, including differential privacy, federated learning, cryptographic protocols, and trusted execution environments. We examine their efficacy in addressing key privacy challenges, such as membership inference and model inversion attacks, while balancing trade-offs between privacy and model utility. Furthermore, we analyze privacy-preserving applications of LLMs in privacy-sensitive domains, highlighting successful implementations and inherent limitations. Finally, this survey identifies emerging research directions, emphasizing the need for novel frameworks that integrate privacy by design into the lifecycle of LLMs. By synthesizing state-of-the-art approaches and future trends, this paper provides a foundation for developing robust, privacy-preserving large language models that safeguard sensitive information without compromising performance.
