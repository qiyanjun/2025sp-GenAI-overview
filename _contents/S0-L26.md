#### FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness
+ Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, Atri Rudra, Christopher Ré
+ [Submitted on 27 May 2022 (v1), last revised 23 Jun 2022 (this version, v2)]
+ Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3× speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4× speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).

#### FlashAttention-2: Faster Attention with Better Parallelism and Work Partitioning
+ Tri Dao
+ [Submitted on 17 Jul 2023]
+ Scaling Transformers to longer sequence lengths has been a major problem in the last several years, promising to improve performance in language modeling and high-resolution image understanding, as well as to unlock new applications in code, audio, and video generation. The attention layer is the main bottleneck in scaling to longer sequences, as its runtime and memory increase quadratically in the sequence length. FlashAttention exploits the asymmetric GPU memory hierarchy to bring significant memory saving (linear instead of quadratic) and runtime speedup (2-4× compared to optimized baselines), with no approximation. However, FlashAttention is still not nearly as fast as optimized matrix-multiply (GEMM) operations, reaching only 25-40\% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s. We observe that the inefficiency is due to suboptimal work partitioning between different thread blocks and warps on the GPU, causing either low-occupancy or unnecessary shared memory reads/writes. We propose FlashAttention-2, with better work partitioning to address these issues. In particular, we (1) tweak the algorithm to reduce the number of non-matmul FLOPs (2) parallelize the attention computation, even for a single head, across different thread blocks to increase occupancy, and (3) within each thread block, distribute the work between warps to reduce communication through shared memory. These yield around 2× speedup compared to FlashAttention, reaching 50-73\% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s on A100 and getting close to the efficiency of GEMM operations. We empirically validate that when used end-to-end to train GPT-style models, FlashAttention-2 reaches training speed of up to 225 TFLOPs/s per A100 GPU (72\% model FLOPs utilization).



#### Efficient Transformers: A Survey
+ Yi Tay, Mostafa Dehghani, Dara Bahri, Donald Metzler
+ [Submitted on 14 Sep 2020 (v1), last revised 14 Mar 2022 (this version, v3)]
+ Transformer model architectures have garnered immense interest lately due to their effectiveness across a range of domains like language, vision and reinforcement learning. In the field of natural language processing for example, Transformers have become an indispensable staple in the modern deep learning stack. Recently, a dizzying number of "X-former" models have been proposed - Reformer, Linformer, Performer, Longformer, to name a few - which improve upon the original Transformer architecture, many of which make improvements around computational and memory efficiency. With the aim of helping the avid researcher navigate this flurry, this paper characterizes a large and thoughtful selection of recent efficiency-flavored "X-former" models, providing an organized and comprehensive overview of existing work and models across multiple domains.

#### Efficient AI in Practice: Training and Deployment of Efficient LLMs for Industry Applications

+ https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14305
+ Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of industrial applications, from search and recommendations to generative tasks. Although scaling laws indicate that larger models generally yield better generalization and performance, their substantial computational requirements often render them impractical for many real-world scenarios at scale. In this paper, we present methods and insights for training small language models (SLMs) that deliver high performance and efficiency in deployment. We focus on two key techniques: (1) knowledge distillation and (2) model compression via quantization and pruning. These approaches enable SLMs to retain much of the quality of their larger counterparts while significantly reducing training, serving costs, and latency. We detail the impact of these techniques on a variety of use cases at a large professional social network platform and share deployment lessons - including hardware optimization strategies that enhance speed and throughput for both predictive and reasoning-based applications.


#### Keep the Cost Down: A Review on Methods to Optimize LLM' s KV-Cache Consumption
+ [Submitted on 25 Jul 2024 (v1), last revised 20 Nov 2024 (this version, v4)]
+ Luohe Shi, Hongyi Zhang, Yao Yao, Zuchao Li, Hai Zhao
+ Large Language Models (LLMs), epitomized by ChatGPT's release in late 2022, have revolutionized various industries with their advanced language comprehension. However, their efficiency is challenged by the Transformer architecture's struggle with handling long texts. KV Cache has emerged as a pivotal solution to this issue, converting the time complexity of token generation from quadratic to linear, albeit with increased GPU memory overhead proportional to conversation length. With the development of the LLM community and academia, various KV Cache compression methods have been proposed. In this review, we dissect the various properties of KV Cache and elaborate on various methods currently used to optimize the KV Cache space usage of LLMs. These methods span the pre-training phase, deployment phase, and inference phase, and we summarize the commonalities and differences among these methods. Additionally, we list some metrics for evaluating the long-text capabilities of large language models, from both efficiency and capability perspectives. Our review thus sheds light on the evolving landscape of LLM optimization, offering insights into future advancements in this dynamic field.

## PPO readings 

### Is DPO Superior to PPO for LLM Alignment? A Comprehensive Study
+ Shusheng Xu, Wei Fu, Jiaxuan Gao, Wenjie Ye, Weilin Liu, Zhiyu Mei, Guangju Wang, Chao Yu, Yi Wu
+ [Submitted on 16 Apr 2024 (v1), last revised 10 Oct 2024 (this version, v3)]
+ Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is currently the most widely used method to align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Existing RLHF methods can be roughly categorized as either reward-based or reward-free. Novel applications such as ChatGPT and Claude leverage reward-based methods that first learn a reward model and apply actor-critic algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). However, in academic benchmarks, state-of-the-art results are often achieved via reward-free methods, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Is DPO truly superior to PPO? Why does PPO perform poorly on these benchmarks? In this paper, we first conduct both theoretical and empirical studies on the algorithmic properties of DPO and show that DPO may have fundamental limitations. Moreover, we also comprehensively examine PPO and reveal the key factors for the best performances of PPO in fine-tuning LLMs. Finally, we benchmark DPO and PPO across a collection of RLHF testbeds, ranging from dialogue to code generation. Experiment results demonstrate that PPO is able to surpass other alignment methods in all cases and achieve state-of-the-art results in challenging code competitions. Our code is publicly available at this https URL.

#### Generative AI on the Edge: Architecture and Performance Evaluation
+ Zeinab Nezami, Maryam Hafeez, Karim Djemame, Syed Ali Raza Zaidi
+ [Submitted on 18 Nov 2024]
+ 6G's AI native vision of embedding advance intelligence in the network while bringing it closer to the user requires a systematic evaluation of Generative AI (GenAI) models on edge devices. Rapidly emerging solutions based on Open RAN (ORAN) and Network-in-a-Box strongly advocate the use of low-cost, off-the-shelf components for simpler and efficient deployment, e.g., in provisioning rural connectivity. In this context, conceptual architecture, hardware testbeds and precise performance quantification of Large Language Models (LLMs) on off-the-shelf edge devices remains largely unexplored. This research investigates computationally demanding LLM inference on a single commodity Raspberry Pi serving as an edge testbed for ORAN. We investigate various LLMs, including small, medium and large models, on a Raspberry Pi 5 Cluster using a lightweight Kubernetes distribution (K3s) with modular prompting implementation. We study its feasibility and limitations by analyzing throughput, latency, accuracy and efficiency. Our findings indicate that CPU-only deployment of lightweight models, such as Yi, Phi, and Llama3, can effectively support edge applications, achieving a generation throughput of 5 to 12 tokens per second with less than 50\% CPU and RAM usage. We conclude that GenAI on the edge offers localized inference in remote or bandwidth-constrained environments in 6G networks without reliance on cloud infrastructure.
