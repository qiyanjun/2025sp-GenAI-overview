+ Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong contextual understanding and remarkable multi-task performance. Therefore, researchers have been seeking to integrate LLMs in the broad sense of Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) field. Different from the traditional method of cascading LLMs to process text generated by Automatic Speech Recognition(ASR), new efforts have focused on designing architectures centered around Audio Feature Extraction - Multimodal Information Fusion - LLM Inference(Speech LLMs). This approach enables richer audio feature extraction while simultaneously facilitating end-to-end fusion of audio and text modalities, thereby achieving deeper understanding and reasoning from audio data. This paper elucidates the development of Speech LLMs, offering an in-depth analysis of system architectures and training strategies. Through extensive research and a series of targeted experiments, the paper assesses Speech LLMs' advancements in Rich Audio Transcription and its potential for Cross-task Integration within the SLU field. Additionally, it indicates key challenges uncovered through experimentation, such as the Dormancy of LLMs under certain conditions. The paper further delves into the training strategies for Speech LLMs, proposing potential solutions based on these findings, and offering valuable insights and references for future research in this domain, as well as LLM applications in multimodal contexts.

#### LLMs Meet Multimodal Generation and Editing: A Survey
+ [Submitted on 29 May 2024 (v1), last revised 9 Jun 2024 (this version, v2)]
+ Yingqing He, Zhaoyang Liu, Jingye Chen, Zeyue Tian, Hongyu Liu, Xiaowei Chi, Runtao Liu, Ruibin Yuan, Yazhou Xing, Wenhai Wang, Jifeng Dai, Yong Zhang, Wei Xue, Qifeng Liu, Yike Guo, Qifeng Chen
+ With the recent advancement in large language models (LLMs), there is a growing interest in combining LLMs with multimodal learning. Previous surveys of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) mainly focus on multimodal understanding. This survey elaborates on multimodal generation and editing across various domains, comprising image, video, 3D, and audio. Specifically, we summarize the notable advancements with milestone works in these fields and categorize these studies into LLM-based and CLIP/T5-based methods. Then, we summarize the various roles of LLMs in multimodal generation and exhaustively investigate the critical technical components behind these methods and the multimodal datasets utilized in these studies. Additionally, we dig into tool-augmented multimodal agents that can leverage existing generative models for human-computer interaction. Lastly, we discuss the advancements in the generative AI safety field, investigate emerging applications, and discuss future prospects. Our work provides a systematic and insightful overview of multimodal generation and processing, which is expected to advance the development of Artificial Intelligence for Generative Content (AIGC) and world models.
