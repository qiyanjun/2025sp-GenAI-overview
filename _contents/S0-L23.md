+ Xupeng Miao, Gabriele Oliaro, Zhihao Zhang, Xinhao Cheng, Hongyi Jin, Tianqi Chen, Zhihao Jia
+ In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), generative large language models (LLMs) stand at the forefront, revolutionizing how we interact with our data. However, the computational intensity and memory consumption of deploying these models present substantial challenges in terms of serving efficiency, particularly in scenarios demanding low latency and high throughput. This survey addresses the imperative need for efficient LLM serving methodologies from a machine learning system (MLSys) research perspective, standing at the crux of advanced AI innovations and practical system optimizations. We provide in-depth analysis, covering a spectrum of solutions, ranging from cutting-edge algorithmic modifications to groundbreaking changes in system designs. The survey aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state and future directions in efficient LLM serving, offering valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in overcoming the barriers of effective LLM deployment, thereby reshaping the future of AI.

+ Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing tasks successfully. Yet, their large size and high computational needs pose challenges for practical use, especially in resource-limited settings. Model compression has emerged as a key research area to address these challenges. This paper presents a survey of model compression techniques for LLMs. We cover methods like quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation, highlighting recent advancements. We also discuss benchmarking strategies and evaluation metrics crucial for assessing compressed LLMs. This survey offers valuable insights for researchers and practitioners, aiming to enhance efficiency and real-world applicability of LLMs while laying a foundation for future advancements.

#### Keep the Cost Down: A Review on Methods to Optimize LLM' s KV-Cache Consumption
+ [Submitted on 25 Jul 2024 (v1), last revised 20 Nov 2024 (this version, v4)]
+ Luohe Shi, Hongyi Zhang, Yao Yao, Zuchao Li, Hai Zhao
+ Large Language Models (LLMs), epitomized by ChatGPT's release in late 2022, have revolutionized various industries with their advanced language comprehension. However, their efficiency is challenged by the Transformer architecture's struggle with handling long texts. KV Cache has emerged as a pivotal solution to this issue, converting the time complexity of token generation from quadratic to linear, albeit with increased GPU memory overhead proportional to conversation length. With the development of the LLM community and academia, various KV Cache compression methods have been proposed. In this review, we dissect the various properties of KV Cache and elaborate on various methods currently used to optimize the KV Cache space usage of LLMs. These methods span the pre-training phase, deployment phase, and inference phase, and we summarize the commonalities and differences among these methods. Additionally, we list some metrics for evaluating the long-text capabilities of large language models, from both efficiency and capability perspectives. Our review thus sheds light on the evolving landscape of LLM optimization, offering insights into future advancements in this dynamic field.

#### Generative AI on the Edge: Architecture and Performance Evaluation
+ Zeinab Nezami, Maryam Hafeez, Karim Djemame, Syed Ali Raza Zaidi
+ [Submitted on 18 Nov 2024]
+ 6G's AI native vision of embedding advance intelligence in the network while bringing it closer to the user requires a systematic evaluation of Generative AI (GenAI) models on edge devices. Rapidly emerging solutions based on Open RAN (ORAN) and Network-in-a-Box strongly advocate the use of low-cost, off-the-shelf components for simpler and efficient deployment, e.g., in provisioning rural connectivity. In this context, conceptual architecture, hardware testbeds and precise performance quantification of Large Language Models (LLMs) on off-the-shelf edge devices remains largely unexplored. This research investigates computationally demanding LLM inference on a single commodity Raspberry Pi serving as an edge testbed for ORAN. We investigate various LLMs, including small, medium and large models, on a Raspberry Pi 5 Cluster using a lightweight Kubernetes distribution (K3s) with modular prompting implementation. We study its feasibility and limitations by analyzing throughput, latency, accuracy and efficiency. Our findings indicate that CPU-only deployment of lightweight models, such as Yi, Phi, and Llama3, can effectively support edge applications, achieving a generation throughput of 5 to 12 tokens per second with less than 50\% CPU and RAM usage. We conclude that GenAI on the edge offers localized inference in remote or bandwidth-constrained environments in 6G networks without reliance on cloud infrastructure.
