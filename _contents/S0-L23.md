#### Towards Efficient Generative Large Language Model Serving: A Survey from Algorithms to Systems
+ Xupeng Miao, Gabriele Oliaro, Zhihao Zhang, Xinhao Cheng, Hongyi Jin, Tianqi Chen, Zhihao Jia
+ In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), generative large language models (LLMs) stand at the forefront, revolutionizing how we interact with our data. However, the computational intensity and memory consumption of deploying these models present substantial challenges in terms of serving efficiency, particularly in scenarios demanding low latency and high throughput. This survey addresses the imperative need for efficient LLM serving methodologies from a machine learning system (MLSys) research perspective, standing at the crux of advanced AI innovations and practical system optimizations. We provide in-depth analysis, covering a spectrum of solutions, ranging from cutting-edge algorithmic modifications to groundbreaking changes in system designs. The survey aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the current state and future directions in efficient LLM serving, offering valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in overcoming the barriers of effective LLM deployment, thereby reshaping the future of AI.

#### Efficient Transformers: A Survey
+ Yi Tay, Mostafa Dehghani, Dara Bahri, Donald Metzler
+ [Submitted on 14 Sep 2020 (v1), last revised 14 Mar 2022 (this version, v3)]
+ Transformer model architectures have garnered immense interest lately due to their effectiveness across a range of domains like language, vision and reinforcement learning. In the field of natural language processing for example, Transformers have become an indispensable staple in the modern deep learning stack. Recently, a dizzying number of "X-former" models have been proposed - Reformer, Linformer, Performer, Longformer, to name a few - which improve upon the original Transformer architecture, many of which make improvements around computational and memory efficiency. With the aim of helping the avid researcher navigate this flurry, this paper characterizes a large and thoughtful selection of recent efficiency-flavored "X-former" models, providing an organized and comprehensive overview of existing work and models across multiple domains. 


#### A Survey on Model Compression for Large Language Models
+ [Submitted on 15 Aug 2023 (v1), last revised 30 Jul 2024 (this version, v4)]

+ Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing tasks successfully. Yet, their large size and high computational needs pose challenges for practical use, especially in resource-limited settings. Model compression has emerged as a key research area to address these challenges. This paper presents a survey of model compression techniques for LLMs. We cover methods like quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation, highlighting recent advancements. We also discuss benchmarking strategies and evaluation metrics crucial for assessing compressed LLMs. This survey offers valuable insights for researchers and practitioners, aiming to enhance efficiency and real-world applicability of LLMs while laying a foundation for future advancements.

#### Generative AI on the Edge: Architecture and Performance Evaluation
+ Zeinab Nezami, Maryam Hafeez, Karim Djemame, Syed Ali Raza Zaidi
+ [Submitted on 18 Nov 2024]
+ 6G's AI native vision of embedding advance intelligence in the network while bringing it closer to the user requires a systematic evaluation of Generative AI (GenAI) models on edge devices. Rapidly emerging solutions based on Open RAN (ORAN) and Network-in-a-Box strongly advocate the use of low-cost, off-the-shelf components for simpler and efficient deployment, e.g., in provisioning rural connectivity. In this context, conceptual architecture, hardware testbeds and precise performance quantification of Large Language Models (LLMs) on off-the-shelf edge devices remains largely unexplored. This research investigates computationally demanding LLM inference on a single commodity Raspberry Pi serving as an edge testbed for ORAN. We investigate various LLMs, including small, medium and large models, on a Raspberry Pi 5 Cluster using a lightweight Kubernetes distribution (K3s) with modular prompting implementation. We study its feasibility and limitations by analyzing throughput, latency, accuracy and efficiency. Our findings indicate that CPU-only deployment of lightweight models, such as Yi, Phi, and Llama3, can effectively support edge applications, achieving a generation throughput of 5 to 12 tokens per second with less than 50\% CPU and RAM usage. We conclude that GenAI on the edge offers localized inference in remote or bandwidth-constrained environments in 6G networks without reliance on cloud infrastructure.
