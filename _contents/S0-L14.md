## Required Readings: 

#### DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning
+ [Submitted on 22 Jan 2025]
+ DeepSeek-AI,  (100 additional authors not shown)
+ We introduce our first-generation reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1. DeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrates remarkable reasoning capabilities. Through RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerges with numerous powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviors. However, it encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL. DeepSeek-R1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on reasoning tasks. To support the research community, we open-source DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, 70B) distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Qwen and Llama.


#### DeepSeekMath: Pushing the Limits of Mathematical Reasoning in Open Language Models

+ Mathematical reasoning poses a significant challenge for language models due to its complex and structured nature. In this paper, we introduce DeepSeekMath 7B, which continues pre-training DeepSeek-Coder-Base-v1.5 7B with 120B math-related tokens sourced from Common Crawl, together with natural language and code data. DeepSeekMath 7B has achieved an impressive score of 51.7% on the competition-level MATH benchmark without relying on external toolkits and voting techniques, approaching the performance level of Gemini-Ultra and GPT-4. Self-consistency over 64 samples from DeepSeekMath 7B achieves 60.9% on MATH. The mathematical reasoning capability of DeepSeekMath is attributed to two key factors: First, we harness the significant potential of publicly available web data through a meticulously engineered data selection pipeline. Second, we introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a variant of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), that enhances mathematical reasoning abilities while concurrently optimizing the memory usage of PPO.
+ Elements: 
  - Both Deepseek and Qwen use GRPO in post-training! Group Relative Policy Optimization or GRPO was introduced in the DeepSeekMath Paper last year to improve mathematical reasoning capabilities with less memory consumption, but is now used in an online way also to improve Truthfulness, Helpfulness, Conciseness… 
  - Generate multiple outputs for each input question using the current Policy
  - Score these outputs using a reward model
  - Average the rewards and use it as a baseline to compute the advantages
  - Update the Policy to maximize the GRPO objective, which includes the advantages and a KL term
+ Insights: 
  - Doesn’t need value function model, reducing memory and complexity
  - Adds KL term directly to the loss rather than in the reward
  - Works with rule-based Reward Models and Generative/Score based RM
  - Looks similar to RLOO method
  - DS 3 improved coding, math, writing, role-playing, and question answering
