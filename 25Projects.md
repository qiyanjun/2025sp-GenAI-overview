### Two options for the final project: 
  + option-1: 25% purely based on your project (You are expected to submit a 8-page double column final project report.) 
  + option-2:  10% for the course attendance + 15% for the quality of your project (4-page double column final project report is needed; if longer and with good quality, extra credits will be given)!  If you are doing really well in your report and presentation, I will give 10 point extra credit (like delivering 8page high quality report + great notebook codebase / slide deck!)



### Details on Final Project and required artifacts: 

+ Each team includes up to two students 
+ Each team is required to submit three artifacts: one report, one codebase and one presentation on their project
+ Each team member needs to submit all three artifact files to their own assignment submission entries in Canvas; 

+ All numbers in the following are percentage of the full grade option that you choose from Option-1 or Option-2. 

+ On the project final presentation (50%): 
  - A formal presentation to the instructors (in the last week of semester), presenting your slide deck and your iPython notebook. 
  - A mini presentation to the instructor (on April 7th) on your project idea is expected during one class session. Two slide pages are enough (more is better!). The mini presentation is expected to explain  (WHY/ WHAT/ HOW of your project idea!)
  - You slide (Due in Canvas on May 7th) summarizes your project via a powerpoint presentation, describing the results you reproduce 
  - Please formulate your project presentation using [this template]({{ site.baseurl }}/Lectures/Project-PresentationTemplate.pptx)
  - A python Jupyter notebook (Due in Canvas on May 7th) to present the code, data visualization, and obtain the results and analysis through step by step code cell run. 
  - Your team will go through and show the notebook file at the final project presentation meeting to the instructors. 
  - Please include one page in your slide deck indicating each team member's work split clearly 


+ On the final presentation of your project: 
  - To minimize the overhead time cost (switching, wrong setup, ….), we will use one instructor’s laptop to
  - 1. Download your team slides (from Canvas) and let you present
  - 2. Download your team iPython Notebook (from Canvas) and let you cell run
  - Please practice the whole process using your own laptop ( I mean checking the files you will submit into Canvas) for more than 3 times.
  - And please make sure the whole process run as smooth as you can. We will use a timer and will cut you off when reaching 15mins.


+ On the project final report (50%): 
  - Here is the grading rubrics we will use to grade your final report 
  - Clear definition of problem and importance (25%)
  - Clear explanation of approach (25%)
  - clear summary of results (and/or difficulties) (25%)
  - Well-organized, polished as a whole (25%) 


### Looking forward to your talks, demos and reports! 

### Potential projects or project types: for example, 
- Build a dataset to evaluate a certain capability of LLMs / VLMs / agents
- Reproduce a GenAI paper 
- Build a GenAI application, like AI-Assisted Blogpost Creation  
- Build a GenAI guardrail, like GenAI generation detetion 
- Build a GenAI application, like misinforamtion / hallucination detection 
- Build a GenAI application, GenAI-Powered audio editing
- Many many more!
