### [The official Academic Calendar at UVA Registrar](http://www.virginia.edu/registrar/calendar.html)


### Prerequisite:

+ Required courses as prerequisites: Machine Learning; Deep learning. The seminar is for research-focused graduate and senior undergraduate students with interests in generative deep learning models, foundations, applications, and related topics. 


### General Description and Disclaimer: 

+ The course will take the form of a seminar instead of lectures by the instructor. 

+ MoWe 3:30pm - 4:45pm  
+ Olsson Hall 009

+ Each class session starts by a presentation (lecture) by a student group, and ended with classroom discussion on the collected questions. After each class session, part of the team of students will write a blogpost or present a demo on the topic. All the students are required to read every session's required readings before it is discussed in a class, and sent their questions through Canvas in advance.


+ It is quite hard to make important topics of Generative AI fit on a one-semester schedule.  We aim to make the course reasonably digestible in an seminar team-learning manner. Our goals here are to highlight the most timing research topics relating to GenAI. We think this teaching style provides students with research centered learning on both knowledge and workflows, helping them build a quick understanding of State-of-the-Art in GenAI.

### Course Expectations

Students in the seminar are expected to:

+ Every team is required to cover four of the class sessions.  Each team include 6+ students, with 4 to 5 delivering slide deck and 2 to deliver a demo on the topic or building a blogpost of the topic. 

+ Before each week, I will share the required readings through email on that week’s papers we plan to cover. Everyone is expected to submit a weekly assignment with 1 question per paper. 

+ For each session, there will be a team of students charged with preparing a topic, analyzing, delivering a lecture and leading the classroom discussions. Part of the same team of students is charged with writing a blog post about that topic. 

+ Participate actively in class meetings. This means being prepared to contribute by doing the assigned preparation (which will typically involve reading a few research papers, but may involve other things also) and thinking about the materials deeply to be able to contribute well to discussions. Part of this preparation will involve posting questions before each class.

+ Each team is expected to include 6 to 7 students.

### Course Grading Policy

+ No exams in this course.
+ Sit-in: No. This course is for registered students only.

+ Final grades will be based on.
  - 40% for the quaity of your seminar presentations;
  - 20% for the quality of your demo sessions ( or blogposts again??) ;
  - 25% for the quality of your project; (project difference: Graduate vs. Under)  
  - 15% for submitting questions before each session 


#### Presentation Lead Team Expectation

As the leading team, your job is to decide what to cover in that class session, prepare slide deck, and lead an interesting, engaging, and illuminating class!

You have one class session to present your topic (either Mon or Wed class), so please don’t just give a series of unconnected, dull presentations. You need to think of things to do in class to make it more worthwhile and engaging. Most class sessions will include presenting ideas using slides, etc.

One weeks before your team is scheduled to lead, you should have an idea what you want to do, tentative list of readings or other materials. We will give you some quick feedback on what you plan to cover, and we will meet on the Sunday or Tues office hours to discuss and go over your slide deck.

The day before your team is scheduled to lead, you should post the materials for the class to instructors, including slide deck,  activities, on the course discussion site. So, the team leading on 02/12  should do this by 0211 at 7:29pm.

After you’ve completed the class meeting, you should help the Blogging team by providing them with your materials, answering their questions, and reviewing their write-up.


#### Demo / Blogpost Team

+ Course Github site to PR your blogpost or demo notebook at [here](https://github.com/qiyanjun/2025sp-GenAI-overview)

The blogging team is responsible for writing a post that summarizes the materials and discussion for the class. A draft of the blog should be submitted as a pull request no later than the following week's Thursday  (instrutors will go over your blogs in the Thursdays' 7:30pm hour office session). Instructions for how to prepare the blog post are on the [Blogging Tactics](https://qiyanjun.github.io/2025sp-GenAI-overview//BloggingTactics/) page.

By the following Friday, we need a final version of the blog post ready and get posted into the course site.


### Academic Integrity
The School of Engineering and Applied Science relies upon and cherishes its community of trust. We firmly endorse, uphold, and embrace the University’s Honor principle that students will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor shall they tolerate those who do. We recognize that even one honor infraction can destroy an exemplary reputation that has taken years to build. Acting in a manner consistent with the principles of honor will benefit every member of the community both while enrolled in the Engineering School and in the future. 


Students are expected to be familiar with the university honor code, including the section on academic fraud. Each assignment will describe allowed collaborations, and deviations from these will be considered Honor violations. If you are in doubt regarding the requirements, please consult with me before you complete any requirement of this course. Unless otherwise noted, exams and individual assignments will be considered pledged that you have neither given nor received help. (Among other things, this means that you are not allowed to describe problems on an exam to a student who has not taken it yet. You are not allowed to show exam papers to another student or view another student’s exam papers while working on an exam.) Send, receiving or otherwise copying electronic files that are part of course assignments are not allowed collaborations (except for those explicitly allowed in assignment instructions). 

Assignments or exams where honor infractions or prohibited collaborations occur will receive a zero grade for that entire assignment or exam, as well as a full letter-grade penalty on the course grade. Such infractions will also be submitted to the Honor Committee if that is appropriate. Students who have had prohibited collaborations may not be allowed to work with partners on remaining homeworks. 


### SDAC and Other Special Circumstances
The University of Virginia strives to provide accessibility to all students. If you require an accommodation to fully access this course, please contact the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) at 434-243-5180 or sdac@virginia.edu. If you are unsure if you require an accommodation, or to learn more about their services, you may contact the SDAC at the number above or by visiting their website at [URL](http://studenthealth.virginia.edu/student-disability-access-center/faculty-staff). 

If you have been identified as an SDAC student, please let the Center know you are taking this class. If you suspect you should be an SDAC student, please schedule an appointment with them for an evaluation. Students who need academic accommodations should see me and contact the SDAC. All academic accommodations must be arranged through the SDAC. 

If you have other special circumstances (athletics, other university-related activities, etc.) please contact instructor and/or TA as soon as you know these may affect you in class. 


### Religious Accommodations
It is the University's long-standing policy and practice to reasonably accommodate students so that they do not experience an adverse academic consequence when sincerely held religious beliefs or observances conflict with academic requirements. Students who wish to request academic accommodation for a religious observance should submit their request in writing directly to me by email as far in advance as possible. Students and instructors who have questions or concerns about academic accommodations for religious observance or religious beliefs may contact the University's Office for Equal Opportunity and Civil Rights (EOCR) at UVAEOCR@virginia.edu or 434-924-3200. 

Accommodations do not relieve you of the responsibility for completion of any part of the coursework missed as the result of a religious observance. 


### Statement on Violence
The University of Virginia is dedicated to providing a safe and equitable learning environment for all students. To that end, it is vital that you know two values that I and the University hold as critically important:

Power-based personal violence will not be tolerated.
Everyone has a responsibility to do their part to maintain a safe community on Grounds.
If you or someone you know has been affected by power-based personal violence, more information can be found on the UVA Sexual Violence website that describes reporting options and resources available - www.virginia.edu/sexualviolence. 

As your professor and as a person, know that I care about you and your well-being and stand ready to provide support and resources as I can. As a faculty member, I am a responsible employee, which means that I am required by University policy and federal law to report what you tell me to the University's Title IX Coordinator. The Title IX Coordinator's job is to ensure that the reporting student receives the resources and support that they need, while also reviewing the information presented to determine whether further action is necessary to ensure survivor safety and the safety of the University community. If you would rather keep this information confidential, there are Confidential Employees you can talk to on Grounds (See http://www.virginia.edu/justreportit/confidential_resources.pdf). The worst possible situation would be for you or your friend to remain silent when there are so many here willing and able to help. 

### This syllabus
This syllabus is to be considered a reference document that can and will be adjusted through the course of the semester to address changing needs. This syllabus can be changed at any time without notification. It is up to the student to monitor this page for any changes. Final authority on any decision in this course rests with the professor, not with this document.
